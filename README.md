# Fortnite Store!

To start, make sure you've cloned the Fortnite-Orders backend:

https://github.com/Dwaynew85/fortnite-orders-rails-backend.git

## Once you have Fortnite-Orders backend:

run `npm install` for all necessary libraries

## Once complete:

run `npm start`

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the Fortnite Store app

From there, you'll be able to look through the list of available items, upcoming items, and order history.

*** Fortnite Orders backend server must be running to view order history ***
